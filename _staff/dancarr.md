Despite not having a beard, Dan has secured 
his second term as Supreme Leader. Beardless, 
fearless, and beautiful, Dan writes hilarious emails,
communicates with our bureaucratic overlords, and is 
actually on OrgSync! When he's not 
dealing swift justice to staff writers, he enjoys 
taking long walks, walking take longs, and longing walk takes.
